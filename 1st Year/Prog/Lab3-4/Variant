Story:"Less than five minutes later, all the short men were lying on the floor like logs. 
As soon as any of them attempted to stand or even move, all four officers ran up to them and began shocking them with electric batons from all sides.
It ended with no one even trying to get to their feet or moving. After casting a victorious glance over the battlefield and confirming that all the short men lay motionless, 
Officer Drigl filled the faucet with water and doused the still-blazing fire in the overturned stove. Instantly, the cell filled with thick steam. 
This remark by Drigl elicited loud laughter from Sigl, Zhmigl, and Pkhigl. Having laughed their fill, all four officers formed a single line and retreated to their original positions.
The door slammed. A key jingled in the lock. Silence fell. Everything around seemed to have gone silent.
Then, one by one, the short men who had hidden there at the very beginning of the fight began to emerge from under the shelves. 
These were the more reasonable inhabitants of the jail, knowing that no matter what the fight was about, it inevitably ended with the police appearing, 
who would deal a beating to everyone indiscriminately: the guilty and the guilty. After a while, those struck down by the electric truncheons also began to come
to their senses and crawl back to their places. After lying on the shelves and resting from the fight, everyone began searching for their things and tidying up the place.
Several of the short men put the stove back in place and lit it again. Gradually, order was restored, all the things were found. Only Striga couldn't find Dunno's hat. 
They both climbed onto their shelves. Kozlik approached Dunno. They began wandering between the shelves, trying to find a free spot. Suddenly, someone tapped Dunno on the shoulder. 
Dunno looked up and saw a short, dark-eyed man on the top shelf who had helped him hide from the police under the bench."
